# TEALS-Python-Rewrite
Rewriting the TEALS Second Semester Python curriculum for Replit Teams for Education

### Notes
Replit Classroom was discontinued in 2020 and Teams was introduced. Shortly after, Replit Teams for Education was implemented and just recently became free for educational use. Around the time Classroom was discontinued, the second semester Python curriculum fo Microsoft TEALS was also deprecated and backed up as a repository on git. This is a project to transfer the original Python curriculum to the new Teams for Education on Replit.
