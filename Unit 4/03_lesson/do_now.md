# Do Now 4.03

## Type in your console

```python
    def print_6_stars():
    my_string = ''
    for i in range(0, 6):
        my_string += ' *'
    print(my_string)
```

## In your notebook

1. Write down what the output of the function `print_6_stars` is.
2. Write a function  `print_star_square` that calls `print_6_stars` in a loop to produce the following output.

```
    >>>python print_stars.py
    * * * * * *
    * * * * * *
    * * * * * *
    * * * * * *
    * * * * * *
    * * * * * *
```

3. Rewrite the function `print_star_square` without using `print_6_stars`.
    * Note that there are two ways (at least) to get the above output, so just try doing both!
