## 1. In your console

### Type in the following:

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(len(a_list))
```

## In your notebook

### Answer the following:

1. What type do you think a_list is? (Hint: look at the variable name.)
2. What does `len` do?
3. Brainstorm how you would print the first element from `a_list`.

## 2. In your notebook, predict what will happen when the program below is run.

### In your console, type the following:

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(a_list[0])
    print(a_list[1])
    print(a_list[2])
    print(a_list[3])
    print(a_list[4])
    print(a_list[5])
    print(a_list[6])
```

### Continue in your notebook.

Describe what happened when the program was run.  Were there any differences from your predictions?
