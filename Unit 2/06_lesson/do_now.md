## Example 1

### Write down in your notebook:

* How would you print out something 10 times? What about 100? What about 1,000?

### Open up the console, type the following code

```python
    while True:
        print('a')
 ```

### In your notebook, write responses for the following:

1. How many times will it print out?
2. What is the output?

## Example 3

        loopCounter = loopCounter + 1
        print('Hello World')
```

### In your notebook, answer the following:
