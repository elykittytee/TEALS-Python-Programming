##  Open up the console. Type the following example code using interactive mode:

### Example 1

```python
    a_list = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
    b_list = a_list[0:2]
    print(a_list)
    print(b_list)
```

#### In your notebook, respond to the following:

1. What happens to `a_list`?
2. What is in `b_list`?

### Example 2

```python
    a_list = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
    a_list.remove('First Item')
    print(a_list)
```

#### Continue in your notebook. Respond to the following questions:

1. What does `remove` do?
2. What is the length of a_list after the remove?

### Example 3

```python
    a_list = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
    popped_value = a_list.pop()
    print(a_list)
    print(popped_value)
```

#### Continue your responses in your notebook:

1. what does `pop` do?
2. What is the difference between `remove` and `pop`?

### Example 4

```python
    a_list = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
    b_list = a_list + ['Third Item']
    print(a_list)
    print(b_list)
```

#### Continue your responses to the following in your notebook:

1. What happens to a_list?
2. What is in b_list?

### Example 5

```python
    a_list = ['First Item']
    print(a_list)
    a_list.append('Second Item')
    print(a_list)
```

#### In your notebook, answer:

1. What does `append` do?
2. What would be the length after `append`?
