# Project 5: EarSketch Song

## Overview

Using Python and EarSketch you will create a complete song consisting of 2 verses, a chorus, and a bridge. We have worked in class to practice creating sections of songs. We'll use that knowledge to create a song using the samples we are given.

### Behavior

* The song will have pattern (verse, chorus, verse2, chorus, bridge, chorus)
* Create 4 different variables that will hold your choice of audio constants.
* The verses should contain some of the same forms, but be independent.
* The project should have at least 4 tracks, and each track should use a different/unique sound file (different constant).
* Each verse should consist of at least 8 measures.
* The chorus should consist of at least 8 measures.
* The bridge should consist of 2-8 measures.
* The song should have a flow and underlying themes that recur via the use of variables.

### Implementation Details

* Use of `for` loop for creating tracks.
* Use of control flow operators.
* Proper use of `fitMedia`, `makeBeat`, `setEffect`.
* Use of user-defined functions for tracking forms and verses and choruses.
* Use of return statements for tracking the measure.
