# Lab 7.01: Create a Color Class

In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors and build a function to combine two colors.

## Background

RGB is a way of storing color data. R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue. Each color is given a value from 0 to 255.

You can use this tool to see the RGB values for different colors: [https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html)

## Lab

1. Create a class, `Color`.
2. Instantiate at least 3 colors.
3. Add attributes of r, g, and b to those instances.
4. Create a function, `add_color`, which takes in two colors and returns a color that is the sum of the two reds, greens, and blues. __Don't forget: the maximum value for R, G, or B is 255.__
